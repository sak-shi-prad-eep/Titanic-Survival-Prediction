# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models. The dataset is taken from the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). Various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest are employed to create predictive models. Additionally, model evaluation and validation checks are carried out using the Deepchecks library. The predictions are logged and monitored using [Arize AI](https://arize.com/) for continuous monitoring in production.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on several input features, such as age, gender, fare, and the class of the ticket they purchased. We implement three different models to achieve this:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**

We also compare the performance of these models using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

In addition to model building, we validate the datasets using **Deepchecks**, ensuring the data quality by checking for duplicates, feature drift, and feature-label correlations.

## Data

The data used in this project is from the Titanic dataset, which contains the following features:
- **Pclass**: Ticket class
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Fare**: Ticket fare
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation
- **Survived**: Target variable indicating if the passenger survived (1) or not (0).


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook/IDE (optional for development)
- Packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `pickle`, `deepchecks`, `streamlit`, `arize-pandas`, `arize.utils`.

## Libraries Used

- **Numpy**: For numerical computations
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Deepchecks**: Data validation and model evaluation
- **Streamlit**: Web app for user input and predictions
- **Arize AI**: Model monitoring in production

## Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial exploration of the Titanic dataset, including missing value handling and data visualization.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding categorical variables, handling missing data, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

3. **Model Training**: Training three different models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest) on the preprocessed data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Confusion matrices are also plotted.

## Deepchecks Validation

We validate the training and testing datasets using **Deepchecks** for:
- **Data Duplicates**: Check for duplicate rows.
- **Train-Test Feature Drift**: Identify any drift between training and testing datasets.
- **Feature-Label Correlation**: Check for strong correlations between features and labels, which could indicate bias or leakage.

## Model Comparison

The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model are compared:

| Model             | Accuracy | Precision | Recall  | F1-Score |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | X%       | X%        | X%      | X%       |
| Naive Bayes         | X%       | X%        | X%      | X%       |
| Random Forest       | X%       | X%        | X%      | X%       |

## Model Deployment with Streamlit

A simple web app is built using **Streamlit** to allow users to input passenger data and predict survival probability using the pre-trained models. The app provides predictions from all three models and logs them for monitoring.

## Monitoring with Arize AI

Model performance and data are logged to **Arize AI** for continuous monitoring in production. The following metrics are tracked:
- Classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Data integrity checks

3. Log predictions and track model performance using Arize AI by setting up your API key and space key.
